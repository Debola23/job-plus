# 💼 JobPlus — React Job Search Platform

**JobPlus** is a fully responsive job search application built with **React.js**. It allows users to search and filter job opportunities by title, location, and employment type (remote, on-site, hybrid). The platform supports infinite scroll, expandable job cards, and graceful fallback to mock data when the API rate limit is hit — making it ideal for both production and development environments.

- ⚡ **Load More Pagination** — Manual infinite scroll trigger with real-time loading indicators
- 🧩 **Expandable Job Cards** — View full descriptions and external apply links
- 📦 **Mock Fallback** — Loads from mock JSON if API fails (e.g. rate limit exceeded)
- 🎨 **Responsive UI** — Tailwind CSS + CSS Modules for fast and clean styling
- 💫 **Smooth Animations** — Expand/collapse powered by Framer Motion
- 🔁 **Routing Support** — React Router for future page navigation
